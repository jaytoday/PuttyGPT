# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the project, please do not create a public issue. Instead, email the project maintainers directly. They will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeframe for addressing the issue.

We take security concerns seriously and will work with you to address any vulnerabilities found. To encourage responsible reporting, we will not take legal action against you or suspend your access to the project if you follow the procedure outlined above.
