Context and Problem Statement
-----------------------------

{Provide a detailed description of the context and the problem that needs to be addressed. Explain the need for a decision and what it aims to achieve. Describe the background of the project and its goals, and outline any constraints or challenges that have led to this decision point.}

Decision Drivers
----------------

- Specificity: Is the option detailed enough to address the problem statement?
- Measurability: Can the option be measured in terms of cost, performance, scalability, and reliability?
- Achievability: Is the option feasible and realistic given the available resources and time?
- Relevance: Is the option aligned with the project's goals and objectives?
- Time-bound: Is the option timely and can it be implemented within the required timeframe?


Overall
